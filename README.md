# Double Pendulum Lyapunov
Calculation and visualization of average maximum Lyapunov exponent for a double pendulum system

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project was made for the Extended Essay "Effect of pendulum mass on the chaos motion of a double system" \
The program calculates and visualizes the average maximum Lyapunov exponent for a double pendulum system with varying initial masses of 0.5-30.0kg for the primary and secondary pendulums. \
Running the program will create a heatmap for all combinations of masses. To download the results as a csv file, use final_result.to_csv('dp_result.csv') after the data frame has been made.
